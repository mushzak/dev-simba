    We'll use your investment plan as a target for how to initially invest your Simba Capital account as well as to perform
    follow-on investments when you make additional deposits, receive dividends, or experience a significant change in the
    market. Smaller accounts (under $5,000) may experience more significant deviations from your investment plan than
    larger accounts due to the limited availability of investment funds. In all cases, however, our state of the art
    portfolio optimizer will select the optimum set of ETF investments to track the performance of your investment plan
    while staying within your invested amount.

    You should set aside a "rainy day fund" in cash to cover at least six months of expenses to handle any unforeseen
    emergencies and, if you’d like, a discretionary fund to invest in opportunities in which you have high conviction.
    The rest should be invested for the long term in a responsible, diversified strategy of the type offered by Simba Capital.
    However, we understand if you want to start with less.

<div id="tip-why-vanguard" class="tip-content hidden">
    <p>We regularly survey the ETF landscape (over 1,400 ETFs) and rank ETFs in each asset class using the objective
        criteria described below. Vanguard ETFs often come out on top. We receive no compensation for recommending
        Vanguard products or any other ETFs.</p> <p><b>How we pick ETFs</b></p> <p>We look for ETFs with the lowest
        annual expense ratios, minimal
        <a target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener external nofollow' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracking_error'>tracking error</a>,
        and sufficient liquidity. Unfortunately, many investors only focus on cost and end up with an ETF that doesn’t
        track its benchmark well, which defeats the purpose of optimizing the mix of asset classes. Poor liquidity can
        create real problems when it comes time to buy a house or pay for your kids’ college.</p> <p><b>Why we recommend
            the same ETFs for everyone</b></p> <p>Our investment recommendations are based on
        <a target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener external nofollow' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory'>Modern Portfolio Theory</a> (MPT),
        a Nobel Prize winning approach that allocates money to asset classes in a proportion that maximizes your
        expected return for your specific risk tolerance. We choose what we believe is the best ETF to represent each
        asset class. Fundamental to MPT is the belief that expected returns are optimized by choosing the right mix of
        asset classes for each individual, not by personalizing the choice of ETF.</p>
</div>

{{-- Assets table, Asset class column --}}

<div id="tip-u-s-stocks" class="tip-content hidden">
    <h5>Why U.S. Stocks?</h5>
    <p>U.S. Stocks are an ownership share in U.S.-based corporations. U.S. Stocks act as the core asset class because
    history demonstrates that they offer significant returns over the long run. While more volatile than bonds,
    U.S. Stocks offer a great risk-adjusted return.</p>
</div>

<div id="tip-foreign-stocks" class="tip-content hidden">
    <h5>Why Foreign Stocks?</h5>
    <p>Foreign Stocks are an ownership share in foreign companies in developed economies like Europe, Australia and Japan.
    Foreign stocks differ from U.S. stocks in two important ways. First, because markets outside the U.S. react
    differently to economic situations, foreign stocks help reduce a portfolio's overall risk. Second, foreign
    stocks provide indirect exposure to currency fluctuations. The historical returns of foreign stocks are lower than
    U.S. stocks and have higher risk, so the main impetus for investing in foreign stocks are their diversifying qualities.</p>
</div>

<div id="tip-emerging-markets" class="tip-content hidden">
    <h5>Why Emerging Markets?</h5>
    <p>Emerging Markets Stocks are an ownership share in foreign companies in newly developing economies like Brazil,
    Russia, India and China. Emerging Markets Stocks offer additional diversification because these investments
    respond differently than foreign developed economies. The historical returns of Emerging Markets Stocks are
    higher than U.S. Stocks, with higher risk. Emerging Markets add the possibility of higher returns to a portfolio
    and additional diversification.</p>
</div>

<div id="tip-dividend-stocks" class="tip-content hidden">
    <h5>Why Dividend Growth Stocks?</h5>
    <p>Dividend Growth Stocks are U.S. stocks that have a history of increasing their dividend payouts over time. They
    tend to be large-cap well-run companies in less cyclical industries and thus less volatile. As of this writing,
    many companies in this asset class have higher dividend yields than their corporate bond yields and the yields
    on U.S. government bonds. In the current low interest rate environment, Dividend Growth Stocks emerge as an
    asset class that offers an income stream and capital growth potential.</p>
</div>

<div id="tip-real-estate" class="tip-content hidden">
    <h5>Why Real Estate?</h5>
    <p>Real Estate represents investments in real estate companies that provide exposure to commercial properties,
    apartment complexes and retail space. Real Estate offers both recurring cash that is distributed to shareholders
    and an investment in the long-term value of the properties. Real Estate also acts as a hedge against inflation.
    Significantly different from both stocks and bonds, real estate is a powerful diversifier.</p>
</div>

<div id="tip-tips" class="tip-content hidden">
    <h5 >Why TIPS?</h5>
    <p>Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) are inflation-indexed bonds issued by the U.S. federal government.
    Unlike nominal bonds, TIPS' principal and coupons are adjusted periodically based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI).
    Although TIPS currently have historical low yields, their inflation-indexed feature and low volatility makes
    them the only asset class that can provide income generation and inflation protection to risk averse investors.</p>
</div>

<div id="tip-corporate-bonds" class="tip-content hidden">
    <h5>Why Corporate Bonds?</h5>
    <p>Corporate Bonds are debt issued by U.S. corporations with investment-grade credit ratings to fund business
    activities. They offer higher yields than U.S. Government Bonds due to higher credit risk, illiquidity and
    callability. In contrast to the U.S. government, most companies have gone through a deleveraging process and
    strengthened their balance sheets.</p>
</div>

<div id="tip-emerging-market-bonds" class="tip-content hidden">
    <h5>Why Emerging Market Bonds?</h5>
    <p>Emerging Market Bonds are debt issued by governments and quasi-government organizations from emerging market
    countries. They offer higher yields than developed market bonds. Historically, Emerging Market Bonds had serial
    defaults in the 1980s, 1990s and even 2000s. However, the world has changed, where investors today worry about
    potential defaults from developed market bonds rather than emerging market bonds. Emerging market countries,
    with younger demographics, stronger economic growth, healthier balance sheets and lower debt-to-GDP ratios,
    have less risk than most investors realize with respect to borrowing money.</p>

    Simba Capital does not charge an advisory fee on your first $10,000 of assets under management. On amounts over $10,000,
    we charge a monthly advisory fee based on an annual fee rate of 0.25%. You will not be charged commissions or exit fees.
</div>

<div id="tip-rebalancing-faq" class="tip-content hidden">
    <p>Your portfolio allocation will drift over time, as some of your holdings outperform others. We continuously
    monitor your portfolio and periodically rebalance it back to your target mix to manage your risk exposure and
    produce more stable returns. When rebalancing, we carefully consider asset class volatility and tax implications.
    Whenever possible we use the reinvestment of your dividends and any subsequent deposits as an opportunity to
    bring your portfolio back to your target mix with purchases rather than sales.</p>
    <p>Analyses by David Swensen,
    the Chief Investment Officer of Yale University, and Burton Malkiel, Emeritus Professor at Princeton University
    and Simba Capital CIO, with Charles Ellis, Founder of Greenwich Associates, found that over two separate 10 year
    periods <b>rebalanced portfolios earned an average of 0.4% more per year</b> versus portfolios that were not rebalanced.*</p>
    <p>Rebalancing will not always increase returns over all periods, but it will always reduce your portfolio risk
    over time and ensure that your portfolio remains consistent with your target allocation.</p>

<div id="tip-taxes-faq" class="tip-content hidden">
    <p>You will have access to Simba Capital’s <b>continuous tax-loss harvesting</b> service to lower your tax bill and
    grow your wealth faster. Tax-loss harvesting could add at least 1% to an average investor's annual after-tax
    returns. Over the next 20 years that could add more than $54,000 to a $100,000 portfolio.
    You can read more about our tax-loss harvesting service <a href="/tax-loss-harvesting">here</a>.
    See <a href="/legal/disclosure">disclosure</a>.</p> <p>Furthermore, for all
    accounts, we use passive ETFs to represent each asset class to minimize short-term capital gains and use
    deposits, withdrawals and reinvestment of dividends as opportunities for interim rebalancing to minimize
    the taxable gains that can arise from periodic rebalancing.</p>
    <p>Note that we also employ a form of tax
    minimization known as <b>differentiated asset location</b>. By this we mean that we use different mixes of
    asset classes for your taxable and retirement portfolios – allowing us, for example, to reduce taxes by
    overweighting tax-efficient asset classes in taxable portfolios. Differentiated asset location should not
    be confused with segregated asset location, which segregates asset classes entirely into one type of account
    or another. We chose not to implement segregated asset location because it is only beneficial to people whose
    retirement accounts represent a large percentage of their net worth which is atypical for our clients.</p>
